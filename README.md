# POSProject

This program was the final exam of a Introduction to C++ course.  It is a simulated point-of-sale system that will run transactions and print
reports for daily, monthly, or yearly periods.

Reports must be run in order, meaning that a daily report for July 22nd, 2019 would need to be run before that day would be
reported in a monthly report for July of 2019.  Running the same day/month's report twice will result in duplicate entries, as
mandated by given assignment specifications.
